# Oracle Property Graph for Real-Time Recommendations

## Workshop Overview

Oracle Database delivers high performance, scalable graph data management, query, and analytics for enterprise applications. State-of-the art graph features are available along with functionality required for enterprise grade applications: fine-grained security, high availability, easy manageability, and integration with other data in an application. Oracleâ€™s converged, multi-model database natively supports graphs, spatial, XML, JSON and other types of data.

The Property Graph feature enables high performance graph analytics in memory using over fifty pre-built algorithms, and graph queries with a SQLlike language PGQL. Customers use Property Graphs in fraud analytics, vulnerability analysis, recommendation systems, and more.

The RDF Graph feature includes native support for W3C standards RDF, OWL, and SPARQL, enabling high performance, scalable SPARQL and SPARQL embedded in SQL queries. Customers use RDF Graphs in linked data and data sharing applications in pharma, publishing, public sector and more. 

## Workshop Requirements

* Access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    * Provided by the instructor for instructor-led workshops
* Access to a laptop or a desktop
    * Requires Microsoft Remote Desktop software
* Knowledge of Python is a plus but not required
* No previous knowledge of machine learning required

## Agenda

- **Lab 0 :** Setup the Lab Environment

This lab introduces the student lab environment and contains the steps to setup the student desktop for connecting to the lab virtual machine.

- **Lab 1 :** Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python

Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) is a component of the Oracle Database Enterprise Edition that makes open source Python ready for the enterprise and big data. OML4Py integrates Python with the Oracle Database and provides a comprehensive, database-centric environment for end-to-end analytical processing. In this lab, the student will learn to use OML4Py to connect to the Oracle Database, move data between Python and the database, and store Python objects in the database.

- **Lab 2 :** Data Preparation and Exploration

Learn to perform exploratory data analysis of database-resident data and apply best practice techniques to prepare the data for machine learning. This hands-on lab highlights the OML4py Transparency Layer, and demonstrates that many familiar Python functions automatically translate to SQL and run inside the database for optimal performance and execution.

- **Lab 3 :** Embedded Python Execution

Embedded Python Execution, a feature of Oracle Machine Learning for Python, gives you the ability to invoke user-defined Python functions in Python engines that run on the Oracle Database server. Learn to store Python code in the database for reuse and sharing, and to invoke third-party Python packages for machine learning on the database server.

- **Lab 4 :** Use Regression to Estimate House Prices

Explore the CA housing prices dataset and build machine learning models for predicting house prices in the state of California. The lab walks through a real-world use case and the steps to apply an AI/ML solution for building accurate prediction models.

- **Lab 5 :** Use AutoML for Automatic Feature and Model Selection

Automate end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems using the emerging AutoML techniques. In this lab you will use the automatic feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning of AutoML, a feature of OML4Py.
